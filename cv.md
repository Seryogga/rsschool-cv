### About Myself:
I worked as in one of private companies during 14 years. I started as customs declarant assistant and grew up to general manager assistant. 

In 2019 I started to work in Turkey as a sales manager and opened my own company. There I've met a full-stack web-developer who inspired me to start learning programming. 

I began to read about HTML, CSS. Learned tags and CSS selectors. Made some projects. Passed some courses on Udemy. But never learned seriously. And now I decided to pass the courses from RS School.

  const taskHTML = `

	<span class="${cssClass}">${task.text}</span>
