### About Myself:
I worked as in one of private companies during 14 years. I started as customs declarant assistant and grew up to general manager assistant. 

In 2019 I started to work in Turkey as a sales manager and opened my own company. There I've met a full-stack web-developer who inspired me to start learning programming. 

I began to read about HTML, CSS. Learned tags and CSS selectors. Made some projects. Passed some courses on Udemy. But never learned seriously. And now I decided to pass the courses from RS School. 

### Skills and Proficiency:
* HTML5, CSS3;
* JavaScript Basics;
* Git, GitHub;
* VS Code; 
* Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator;
